Ingredients:
	- 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream
	- 1 1/2 cups of whole milk
	- 1 cup of granulated sugar
	- 4 large egg yolks
	- 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract
	- 2 pints of straberries, hulled and cut into large dice (about three cups)

Directions:
	1. Prepare an ice water bath by filling a bowl halfway with ice and water; set aside. Combine cream, milk, and 3/4 cup of 	 the sugar in a large saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir occasionally until sugar is dissolved, about 	5 minutes.

	2. Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks in a large bowl until foamy and light in color, about 3 minutes. Remove cream mixture from 	heat and slowly pour about 1 cup into the egg yolks, whisking constantly.

	3. Pour cream-egg mixture back into the pan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until custard coats the back 	of the spoon, about 5 minutes. (When you draw your finger across the spoon, it should make a mark through the custard, 	   which should not run back in on itself.)

	4. Remove custard from heat and strain into a large heatproof bowl. Stir in vanilla and place mixture over the ice water 	bath to chill, about 10 to 15 minutes.

	5. Meanwhile, combine strawberries and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a medium bowl and toss to coat. Let berries macerate for 	  10 minutes at room temperature. Using a potato masher or a pastry blender, mash until fruit is mostly pea-size and 	   very saucy, then add to the cooling ice cream base.

	6. Once the ice cream base is cold, cover and place in the refrigerator to chill completely, at least 3 hours or overnight.

	7. Once the base is thoroughly chilled, freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The ice 	  cream will keep in the freezer for up to 10 days.
